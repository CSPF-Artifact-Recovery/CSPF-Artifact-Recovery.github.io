<p class="report"><p>SESSION ONE SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>The Deep - Cloudbank Synthetic Production Facility
Used to be THE production factory for androids.</p>
<p>We are broke 🤑 so we need to dive to get artifacts🗿</p>
<p>The Bell 🔔 - Station @ Edge of Rim space
Dark station - rendezvous point.</p>
<p>Arkady (character)- retired
Ship - The Acheron, to and from the deep.
Has a lost and found
Has a bunk with a computer. 🖥️

Informs 'Room 3.1 artifact in some bones' we can keep it</p>
<p>Chapel
Big whale with crucifix skeleton made of metal - is it an android?
Noriko (Character) - priest 🙏
Worships the Minatour ? - who will 'free humanity from trials' 🧌

Seems creepy</p>
<p>Garden of Napishtum
Lights that grow crops
Shrines</p>
<p>Greatest AI ever - Monarch (Character) rules the deep</p>
<p>Ghost eater (Character)
Wears black helmet
Gleaming red eyes
More machine than man
Also seems creepy</p>
<p>Arkady ''Some people come back a little different
People don't stay dead' (about the deep)</p>
<p>Floor one - Reception
Graffiti on the dock
Lots of violence towards androids noted
Emergency blue lights. 🆘
Desk - body hanging by a rope "One way out" on wall
Chloe (Megan) scans body - It's an android 🤖 ?! Very realistic, never seen anything like it - realistic skin and hair etc
Androids blood usually white, this is red
Logic Core from the Android (Archadi will pay for this)</p>
<p>Meeting room A
Back pack - loot expired Stim packs, shotgun rounds and a torch 🔦</p>
<p>Meeting room B
Pile of books
EMP Mine (Electro Magnetic Pulse) that damages technology 💣
And a poem in binary about thoughts
Maybe a trap - for who</p>
<p>Cafeteria
Feels like a prison
Smell of fresh food 🍔
Jack (Will) stole Rat statue 🐀</p>
<p>Fee (Charlotte) back to Reception
Manage to print off map of first floor. 🗺️
Hear foot steps coming from where we got dropped off.
Inform group someone's coming + we hide in freezer. 🥶</p>
<p>Troubleshooters know exactly where we were (why?)
About to kill us
Then Androids appear (What, Why?!)
Troubleshooters fight Androids. 🔫</p>
<p>Jack (Will) throws explosives and kills remaining Troubleshooters</p>
<p>Group runs and goes down corridor further into Deep. Realises tracker in torch that we looted earlier. We destroy tracker.</p>
<p>Check out storage room
Retinal scanner 👁️ with sign 'access' lock we didn't try to open. Seems logical to assume just androids can open it?

Hear footsteps going further into the deep 😱</p>
