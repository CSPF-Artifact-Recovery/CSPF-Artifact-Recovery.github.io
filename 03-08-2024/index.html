<hr />
<p class="report"><p>&gt; New divers identified entering "The Bell".
Zeb (Jack), Chloe (Megan), Jack (Will), Fee (Charlotte), Tristen (Lewis)</p>
<p>&gt; Divers must have bribed the blockade.</p>
<p>&gt; Divers greeted by Arkady "retired" diver who coordinates dives into the deep.</p>
<p>Divers explore the Bell with Arkady, noting the Chapel and the garden.</p>
<p>&gt; Zeb flirts with Noriko, priest in the chapel, whilst Jack serenades on his saxophone.</p>
<p>Noriko is a worshipper of the "Minotaur".</p>
<p>Zeb contemplates salvation in the arms of <s>Noriko</s> the Minotaur.</p>
<p>&gt; Divers learn that the Cloudbank Synthetics production facility ("The Deep") was abandoned following a take-over from resident AI "Monarch".</p>
<p>&gt; Arkady runs transport to and from the Deep every 24 hours.</p>
<p>He arrives each morning at 08:00 and stays for one hour.</p>
<p>At 09:00 he leaves the Deep and returns to the Bell.</p>
<p>Divers can either return to his shuttle within the hour after arrival or expect to rendezvous with Arkady the next day.</p>
<p>-- DIVERS EMBARK --</p>
<p>&gt; Divers embark on their inaugural dive.</p>
<p>-- RECEPTION AREA --</p>
<p>&gt; Divers arrive in the reception area of 22B.</p>
<p>&gt; A body is identified.
Chloe scans the body and identifies it is an android.</p>
<p>This shocks the crew. The android appears uncannily human.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests this android was "forcefully retired".</p>
<p>&gt; Chloe salvages the logic core from the expired android.</p>
<p>-- MEETING ROOM A --</p>
<p>&gt; Divers find an abandoned backpack. It contains Stim packs, shotgun rounds and a torch.</p>
<p>(insert foreshadowing here)</p>
<p>-- MEETING ROOM B --</p>
<p>&gt; In meeting room B there is a curious pile of books and an item stashed amongst them.</p>
<p>&gt; Whilst everyone watches from the doorway, Zeb (hoorah), trips an EMP mine recovering an artifact.</p>
<p>&gt; Zeb recovers an epic poem artifact written in binary.</p>

<p>-- CAFETERIA --</p>
<p>&gt; Can smell fresh food in here (do androids eat?)</p>
<p>&gt; Fee splits off and heads back to reception to interface with the computer network.</p>
<p>&gt; Zeb and Jack find some cigarettes and ammunition in the kitchen by a golden rat statue.</p>
<p>Jack sees $_$ and pockets the rat statue.</p>
<p>-- RECEPTION AREA --</p>
<p>&gt; Meanwhile Fee is able to interface with the local network and download a map of the first floor. Much smarts.</p>
<p>&gt; Suddenly marching can be heard from the docking bay. Panik. Fee runs back to the cafeteria.</p>
<p>-- CAFETERIA --</p>
<p>&gt; Fee gets back and warns the group.</p>
<p>All agree to run into the freezer to hide (brr)</p>
<p>&gt; 10 armed humanoids in black armour with red visors (troubleshooters?) know that divers are hiding in the freezer.</p>
<p>How do they know?!
Well this is probably it then.
Divers prepare for last stand.
(⌐■_■)</p>
<p>&gt; Suddenly...
Androids ambush the troubleshooters and firefight breaks out in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>&gt; bruh</p>
<p>&gt; Jack uses this moment to throw a remote detonator at the 4 troubleshooters remaining in the Kitchen.</p>
<p>Success! They are all forcefully retired.</p>
<p>&gt; Everyone tries to make a break for it back to the meeting rooms.</p>
<p>Tristen is old and runs like he's old and gets shot like he's old.</p>
<p>Jack also gets hurt but the "CCTV footage" is fuzzy and I can't remember why.</p>
<p>-- MEETING ROOM A --</p>
<p>&gt; The divers discover that the loot from the backpack they found earlier was a trap.</p>
<p>The shotgun shelves were empty, the stimpacks had expired and the torch had a tracker hidden within.</p>
<p>Probably shouldn't pick up random backpacks anymore.</p>
<p>&gt; The tracker is decommissioned.</p>
<p>-- STORAGE ROOM --</p>
<p>&gt; Continuing to explore the divers find a storage room.</p>
<p>&gt; Not much in here, mostly boxes.</p>
<p>&gt; Zeb opens up a box and hallucinates an android head is talking to him.</p>
<p>Creepy af. Another logic core though. Thanks Zeb.</p>
<p>-- EMPLOYEE REC ROOM --</p>
<p>&gt; Opposite the storage room the divers enter a gym.</p>
<p>&gt; Unconscious within a locker is Donnie the diver. Bit sus. Great name tho.</p>
<p>Donnie says he found a one in a million artifact but his partner crossed him and knocked him out.</p>
<p>&gt; The group hangs out with Donnie before heading back to the dock to rendezvous with Arkady the next morning.</p>
<p>-- THE BELL --</p>
<p>&gt; Jack shows off his Rat statue to Arkady hoping to impress him.</p>
<p>Arkady scolds him and informs everyone that the statue needs to be returned or food will no longer be cooked in the kitchen area (complete with newly fitted entrance).</p>
<p>&gt; Upon arriving back at the Bell, the divers take the time to cool down, decompress and reflect on wtf just happened.</p>
<p>CASUALTIES: NONE
VALUABLE LOOT: 2X LOGIC CORES, FEW GUNS, EPIC POEM.</p>
<p>-- END REPORT --</p>
