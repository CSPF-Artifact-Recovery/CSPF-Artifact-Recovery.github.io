SESSION ONE SYNOPSIS 

The Deep - Cloudbank Synthetic Production Facility 
Used to be THE production factory for androids.

We are broke 🤑 so we need to dive to get artifacts🗿

The Bell 🔔 - Station @ Edge of Rim space 
Dark station - rendezvous point.

Arkady (character)- retired 
Ship - The Acheron, to and from the deep.
Has a lost and found 
Has a bunk with a computer. 🖥️
Hash marks - days he's been here
Informs 'Room 3.1 artifact in some bones' we can keep it

Chapel 
Big whale with crucifix skeleton made of metal - is it an android?
Noriko (Character) - priest 🙏
Worships the Minatour ? - who will 'free humanity from trials' 🧌
Maintains the garden
Has received the minatours guidance 
Seems creepy 

Garden of Napishtum
Lights that grow crops 
Shrines 

Greatest AI ever - Monarch (Character) rules the deep

Ghost eater (Character)
Wears black helmet 
Gleaming red eyes
More machine than man
Also seems creepy 

Arkady ''Some people come back a little different 
People don't stay dead' (about the deep)

Floor one - Reception 
Graffiti on the dock 
Lots of violence towards androids noted
Emergency blue lights. 🆘
Desk - body hanging by a rope "One way out" on wall 
Chloe (Megan) scans body - It's an android 🤖 ?! Very realistic, never seen anything like it - realistic skin and hair etc 
Androids blood usually white, this is red
Logic Core from the Android (Archadi will pay for this)

Meeting room A
Back pack - loot expired Stim packs, shotgun rounds and a torch 🔦 

Meeting room B
Pile of books
EMP Mine (Electro Magnetic Pulse) that damages technology 💣
And a poem in binary about thoughts
Maybe a trap - for who

Cafeteria 
Feels like a prison 
Smell of fresh food 🍔
Jack (Will) stole Rat statue 🐀

Fee (Charlotte) back to Reception 
Manage to print off map of first floor. 🗺️
Hear foot steps coming from where we got dropped off.
Inform group someone's coming + we hide in freezer. 🥶

Troubleshooters know exactly where we were (why?)
About to kill us
Then Androids appear (What, Why?!)
Troubleshooters fight Androids. 🔫

Jack (Will) throws explosives and kills remaining Troubleshooters

Group runs and goes down corridor further into Deep. Realises tracker in torch that we looted earlier. We destroy tracker.

Check out storage room 
Retinal scanner 👁️ with sign 'access' lock we didn't try to open. Seems logical to assume just androids can open it?
Zeb (Jack) finds head of Android that knows his name (Creepy)

Go into next room (gym) we find Donny-the-Diver 🤿 unconscious in a locker.
Hear footsteps going further into the deep 😱

Having escaped death once we head back to the Bell 🔔 

Arkady tells us the rat statue we have needs to go back to the kitchen as it is what causes the food to be made. 🙃
